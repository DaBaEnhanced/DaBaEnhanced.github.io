<div style="text-align: center;">
<h1>Mother</h1>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Mother,<br>
let me close my eyes<br>
and dream of endless skies<br>
<br>
Mother,<br>
let me close my eyes<br>
and look through the disguise<br>
<br>
Look through this false life<br>
into the abyss of the afterlife<br>
<br>
Mother,<br>
will you guide me<br>
Through this sorrow land<br>
<br>
Mother,<br>
will you guide me<br>
Through this last stand<br>
<br>
Soothe me and take my hand<br>
as she reap my lifeâ€™s last strand<br>
<br>
Mother,<br>
let me rest on your shoulder<br>
as my soul grows colder<br>
<br>
Mother,<br>
hug me in a bed of flower<br>
and lay my body in a steel tower<br>
<br>
Let me cry, for my time has drawn near<br>
Oh, Mother, let me cry,<br>
till my mind is devoid of fear<br>
For the reaper is finally here<br>
skinning me, tier after tier<br>
</div>
