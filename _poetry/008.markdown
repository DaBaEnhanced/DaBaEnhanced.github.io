<div style="text-align: center;">
<h1>Wounds</h1>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
In this limbo, awaiting.<br>
In this darkness, fearing.<br>
In this silence, shouting.<br>
Undead and Unliving,<br>
maybe dreaming.<br>
<br>
Where the river of tears wane.<br>
Where the sea of sorrow crashed<br>
on the sullen shores of my pain,<br>
She awaits me, to my remorses latched.<br>
<br>
Don’t stop now, whore.<br>
Keep punching. Keep beating.<br>
Till everything is sore<br>
Till every piece of my heart’s bleeding.<br>
<br>
As in Life, so in Death,<br>
we will be one, again.<br>
</div>
