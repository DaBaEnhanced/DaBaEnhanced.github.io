<div style="text-align: center;">
<h1>Love Me</h1>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Love me<br>
Love me<br>
Love me<br>
<br>
As a father adore his son<br>
A woman her lover<br>
<br>
Love me<br>
Love me<br>
Love me<br>
<br>
As a soldier adore his country<br>
A man of faith his God<br>
<br>
Love me<br>
Love me<br>
Love me<br>
<br>
As a child adore his teddy bear<br>
A boy his mother<br>
<br>
Damn love me<br>
</div>
