<div style="text-align: center;">
<h1>Remember Me</h1>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Like paper boats<br>
sailing on desperate seas<br>
<br>
Like burning candles<br>
fighting against the wind<br>
<br>
Will you remember me?<br>
Will you remember me?<br>
<br>
As the mist slowly grows<br>
and memories froze<br>
<br>
As the pain gently wither<br>
and my sanity desperately slither<br>
<br>
Will you remember me?<br>
Will you remember me?<br>
<br>
Torn roses and muffled cries<br>
As the red sun slowly rise,<br>
<br>
Remember me, Remember me.<br>
</div>
