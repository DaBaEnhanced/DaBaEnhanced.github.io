<div style="text-align: center;">
<h1>The Strawman</h1>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
Sometimes<br>
i feel like cold stone<br>
Sometimes<br>
i feel like burning fire<br>
A diamond heart<br>
compressed hate<br>
Strong as Lion<br>
As a Warrior of old<br>
Fearless,<br>
<br>
Sometimes<br>
I feel constantly numb<br>
Sometimes<br>
I feel constantly dull<br>
A hollow shell,<br>
empty space.<br>
Old and powerless,<br>
loathing<br>
all that remains<br>
<br>
I must scream<br>
But I have no mouth<br>
I must see<br>
But I have no eyes<br>
I must hear<br>
But I have no ears<br>
I must feel<br>
But I have no soul<br>
I must love<br>
But I have no heart<br>
<br>
Let me live in darkness<br>
Let me live in solitude<br>
Let me live among illusions<br>
and screeching crows<br>
Goddamned and sublime.<br>
</div>
