### Between the genius and the madness of artificial intelligence.<br>

I work in AI with my daily job, but in my free time i like to dabble with various generative tools to create weird stuff and test the limits of their "human-likeness" or "inhuman-likeness" mostly.

Poetry section is 99% human made (translation are half done with AI)

Shorts are 99% AI made (I just gave the basic plot) using Claude 3.7.

Videos are 99% AI made too, I just used an image generation model. Combined with some constrained initialization and custom evolving prompting I generated weird and dream-like trippy experience.
Models range from SD 1.5 to SDXL (mostly finetuned checkpoints found on <a href="https://civitai.com/">CivitAI</a>) using the <a href="https://deforum.art/">deforum</a> py code as a starting point.
Videos are upsampled to 2k using pretty standard ESRGAN models.

As far as the various picture on this site they were generated using <a href="https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/Kolors">Kolors</a><br>

I'm also exploring some text-to-speech open-source models to generate audiobook style stuff for the short stories.<br>
