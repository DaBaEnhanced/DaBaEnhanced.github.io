### Between the genius and the madness of artificial intelligence.<br>

I work in AI with my daily job, but in my free time i like to dabble with various generative tools to create weird stuff and test the limits of their "human-likeness" or "inhuman-likeness" mostly.

Written stuff is mostly 99% human made (translations are mostly done with AI, some poems were directly written in English though)

Videos are 99% AI made too, I just used an image generation model. Combined with some constrained initialization and custom evolving prompting I generated weird and dream-like trippy experience.
Models range from SD 1.5 to SDXL (mostly finetuned checkpoints found on <a href="https://civitai.com/">CivitAI</a>) using the <a href="https://deforum.art/">deforum</a> py code as a starting point.
Videos are upsampled to 2k using pretty standard ESRGAN models.

As far as the various picture on this site they were generated using <a href="https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/Kolors">Kolors</a>, ChatGPT or GROK. I think there's a handfull generated with Kandinsky. All are animated by Grok.

I'm also exploring some text-to-speech open-source models (with varying degree of success) to generate audiobook style stuff for the short stories.<br>
