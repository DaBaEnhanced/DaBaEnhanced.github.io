### Between the genius and the madness of artificial intelligence.<br>

I work in AI with my daily job, but in my free time i like to dabble with various generative tools to create weird stuff and test the limits of their "human-likeness" or "inhuman-likeness" mostly.

Poetry section is 99% human made (translation are half done with AI)

Shorts are 99% AI made (I just gave the basic plot)

Videos are 99% AI made too, I just used an image generation model. Combined with some constrained initialization and custom evolving prompting I generated weird and dream-like trippy experience.<br><br>
