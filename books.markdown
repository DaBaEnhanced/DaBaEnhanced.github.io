This is a collection of the various full lenght books I've published.

## The Arks Series.

No spoilers. 9 books are planned for this series, I already have most of the plots set up, just need to find the time to write them.

## The Consent Engines Series

Consent Engines is a hard-science saga set in a far-future diaspora that survives on standards, consent, and ships you can fix with a checklist. Humans are almost immortals, families live for centuries aboard magsails arks that travel at sub-light speeds between star systems; exchange marriages keep diversity alive; sentient companions serve as auditors and partners. Courts convene under auroras, mirror budgets stay stingy, and sodium clouds turn space into evidence.

Each book tackles a different front in the same struggle: keeping power honest across decades-long distances—through loop biology and law, magsails and magnetospheres, procedure and love. Expect quiet heroism, adversaries who argue in good faith (until they don’t), and victories won by welds, proofs, and patience.

I tried to experiment a bit with the language itself, so the book is filled with language quirks and idioms from the far future.

6 books are planned for this series.

## A collection of my short stories.

A scientist tries to outrun time’s ripples. A comedian is put on trial for the wrong word. Reality freezes, restarts, and talks back. On ice moons and in failing cities, humans and machines bargain for what’s left of meaning—and what it costs to keep it.

Short Stories gathers sharp, fast, big-idea sci-fi that hits like a meteor: wonder, wit, and the occasional gut-punch. These tales peel back the veneer of normal life to reveal the systems humming underneath—algorithms that nudge our desires, courts that stage our morality, and futures where love is measured in experiments you can’t safely repeat. Some stories end in quiet grace, some in black humor, and some with the floor dropping out from under you.

If you like mind-bending twists, tight worldbuilding, and heart under pressure, this collection is your next late-night problem. Open anywhere. Read one on your commute or three before bed. Just don’t expect the lights to feel the same when you turn them off.
