Elias Kane leaned against the railing of the hospital's emergency stairwell, eyes closed, breathing controlled. The hunt was on again. His specialized gear hummed silently against his spine, ready to capture what he needed.<br>
Three floors up, a motorcycle crash victim fought for their life. His research had been precise – massive trauma, minimal chance of survival, no family present. Perfect conditions.<br>
He climbed each step deliberately, savoring the anticipation. This wasn't about watching someone die. This was about experiencing it.<br>
When he reached the correct floor, he slipped into an alcove near the trauma unit. The doctors worked frantically as monitors screamed warnings. Elias activated his equipment, feeling the familiar tingle as connections established.<br>
The first wave hit him like lightning – searing pain across shattered bones, the copper taste of blood, lungs struggling against collapsed tissue. His body shuddered involuntarily as endorphins flooded his system, interpreting another person's dying signals.<br>
Then came the fear – primal, overwhelming, magnificent. The desperate clinging to life, the recognition of its slipping away. This was the purest high, the impossible experience most would never know until their own end came.<br>
The victim's consciousness began fragmenting. Memories cascaded like broken glass – childhood summers, a lover's face, regrets and triumphs all compressed into seconds. Elias trembled as he captured it all, teeth clenched against the intensity.<br>
When it ended, he disconnected, slumping against the wall. His body pulsed with borrowed sensation, the ghost of someone else's finale echoing through his neurons.<br>
Back in his apartment, surrounded by specialized servers storing hundreds of similar recordings, Elias reviewed his newest acquisition. The medical community called people like him "sync-vamps" – neural vampires who fed not on blood but on the most profound human experiences.<br>
His collection was impressive – mountain climbers in avalanches, stroke victims in their final clarity, soldiers caught in explosions. Each death or near-death experience was unique, unrepeatable, a consumable piece of human existence he could replay at will.<br>
The authorities would never understand. How could they? They hadn't felt what he had felt. They couldn't know the addiction of living a thousand endings while continuing to exist.<br>
He carefully cataloged tonight's experience, adding it to the others. The hunger would return soon enough. It always did.<br>
As he slid the new memory card into his archive, Elias reflected on how it had begun. Five years ago, he'd been a brilliant but unremarkable neurosensory engineer, developing medical equipment to help coma patients communicate. The technology was meant to record patient experiences for diagnosis – not to transmit the full sensory spectrum to another person's nervous system. That modification had been his private innovation.<br>
His first taste was accidental – a terminal patient whose final moments flooded Elias's consciousness during equipment testing. The rush had been unlike anything he'd experienced. Where others saw only flat lines on monitors, he had felt the sublime, terrifying beauty of a consciousness extinguishing.<br>
Elias ran his fingers along the row of meticulously labeled memory cards. Each contained a death or near-death experience, cataloged by intensity, emotional resonance, and clarity. Some he returned to often – the skydiver whose parachute failed, the elderly writer who slipped peacefully away while remembering her greatest love. Others were too intense even for his calibrated nervous system.<br>
The underground community of sync-vamps was small but growing. They traded experiences like rare wines, each with its own terroir of emotional and sensory notes. But Elias was a purist. He collected only what he harvested personally.
Lately, though, something troubled him. The experiences were becoming... insufficient. Each high shorter, each return to reality more jarring. He needed something more profound.<br>
His fingers lingered over a black memory card, separate from the others. Unlike the rest, this one contained no recording. Not yet. This was reserved for his masterpiece – his own death experience, to be captured and broadcast to select collectors when the time came.<br>
He hoped it would be spectacular enough to be worth the price.<br>
The hunger gnawed at him again as the motorcycle victim's sensations began to fade. Tomorrow there would be another hunt. There was always another hunt. The city never stopped providing endings for him to consume.<br>
And in the quiet moments between his feedings, Elias sometimes wondered if he was still human at all, or if he had become something else entirely – a creature sustained not by blood, but by the most intimate moments of human existence, a parasite feeding on the threshold between life and death.<br>
