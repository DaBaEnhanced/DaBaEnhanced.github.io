The observation deck of the ISV Hawking offered the best view in the solar system. Commander Eliza Chen stood alone, watching Saturn's rings slice across the panorama like a cosmic artist's brushstroke. Humanity's first crewed mission to the ringed planet had been a triumph of engineering and international cooperation, but as they prepared to begin their final orbital sequence, Eliza couldn't shake her growing unease.<br>
The anomalies had started three days ago. Inexplicable power fluctuations. Strange readings from the external sensors. And then there were the lights—brief flashes in Saturn's upper atmosphere that defied explanation.<br>
_"Commander,"_ Rajiv's voice crackled through the comms. _"You need to see this."_<br>
In the science lab, the crew had gathered around the main display. A gravitational wave detector they'd deployed was showing impossible readings.<br>
_"It's as if something massive is moving through subspace,"_ Rajiv explained, his voice tight with excitement. _"The waveform doesn't match anything in our database."_<br>
Hours later, they got their answer.<br>
It emerged from behind Titan—a structure of impossible geometry, surfaces that seemed to fold in on themselves, composed of a material that absorbed rather than reflected light. It was unmistakably artificial, unmistakably alien, and it was heading directly toward them.<br>
First contact protocols were initiated. Earth was notified. But at this distance, their message wouldn't reach home for over an hour.
They were on their own.<br>
The alien vessel—if that's what it was—stopped precisely two kilometers from the Hawking. No communication. No aggression. Just waiting.<br>
_"We should send a signal,"_ suggested Dr. Katsumi Nakamura, their exobiologist. _"Something simple. Mathematical sequences."_<br>
They tried everything: prime numbers, geometric ratios, even music. Nothing.<br>
Then something unexpected happened. Their own communications array activated without command, sending out a precisely modulated signal.<br>
_"It's coming from inside our systems,"_ explained Elena, their systems engineer, fingers flying over her console. _"But I didn't initiate this."_<br>
_"What's it sending?"_ demanded Eliza.<br>
Elena looked up, her face pale. _"It's sending our mission logs. Our flight data. Everything."_<br>
_"We've been compromised,"_ said Rajiv.<br>
_"No,"_ Katsumi whispered. _"We've been observed. All along."_<br>
The alien vessel began to change shape, unfolding into a configuration that seemed to mirror the Hawking's own profile.
And then, finally, communication—not through radio or light, but directly through their ship's operating system. A simple message appeared on all screens:<br>
_"BATCH 7 ASSESSMENT COMPLETE. HARVEST PROTOCOL INITIATED."_<br>
What followed was a data dump so massive it nearly overloaded their systems. The crew stared in horror as they witnessed the truth of humanity's origins unfold before them.<br>
Earth had never been their planet. It was a laboratory. A breeding ground.<br>
Each major extinction event throughout Earth's history had been deliberate—reset buttons to correct course when evolution strayed from the intended path. The dinosaurs hadn't died from an asteroid; they'd been eliminated when they failed to develop as planned.<br>
Humans were simply the latest iteration in a billion-year weapons program.<br>
The genetic sequences that appeared on screen confirmed it. The aliens hadn't just watched human evolution—they had engineered it meticulously. The development of opposable thumbs, bipedal movement, advanced problem-solving, heightened aggression, pack bonding that could be redirected to unquestioning loyalty—all carefully cultivated traits.<br>
_"Do you understand what this means?"_ Katsumi's voice shook as she analyzed the data. _"Our capacity for violence, our tribal instincts, our ability to withstand extreme conditions—these weren't evolutionary accidents."_<br>
_"We're weapons,"_ Eliza whispered.<br>
The final images showed the aliens' home galaxy—locked in an ancient war with a species they could not defeat through technology alone. They needed biological weapons that could adapt, heal, and most importantly, reproduce themselves.
They needed soldiers.<br>
As a paralyzing beam of energy enveloped the ship, the crew's muscles locked in place. Through the viewport, Eliza watched helplessly as a docking tube extended from the alien vessel. The final message flickered across their screens:<br>
_"BATCH 7 COMBAT CAPABILITY: EXCELLENT.<br>
AGGRESSION PROFILE: OPTIMAL.<br>
INTELLIGENCE: SUFFICIENT.<br>
LOYALTY PROGRAMMING: PENDING.<br>
BEGINNING HARVEST OF ALL SPECIMENS.<br>
EARTH PRODUCTION QUOTA: 8 BILLION UNITS."_<br>
The airlock hissed open. Eliza couldn't scream, couldn't move, could only watch as something entered—something with too many limbs and eyes that held no compassion, only cold assessment.
And she understood the most horrific truth of all: they weren't coming home.<br>
They were being collected.<br>
