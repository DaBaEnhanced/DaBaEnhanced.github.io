The morning light filtered through lace curtains, casting dappled shadows across Thomas's bedroom floor. He stretched, feeling the pleasant ache of yesterday's labor in his muscles. Spring had arrived in Meadowbrook, and with it came the yearly ritual of preparing the soil for planting.
Thomas dressed slowly, savoring the cool touch of cotton against his skin. Through his window, he could see neighbors already at work in their gardens. Mrs. Wilkins was hanging laundry, sheets billowing like sails in the gentle breeze. Old man Fletcher was repairing his fence, the rhythmic tap of his hammer a familiar comfort.<br>
_"Another perfect day,"_ Thomas whispered, running his fingers along the windowsill where a thin layer of pollen had settled overnight.<br>
Downstairs, he prepared a simple breakfast—fresh bread from the village bakery, a soft-boiled egg from his own hens, and tea brewed with mint from his garden. He ate on the porch, watching bees drift lazily between the wild roses that climbed his trellis.<br>
The village of Meadowbrook occupied a small valley, surrounded by rolling hills that seemed to change color with the passing hours. Now, in early morning, they were a misty blue-green, mysterious and inviting.<br>
Thomas had planned to spend the day tilling his vegetable patch, but perhaps he would take a walk to the hillside instead. The blueberries might be ready for picking, and the view from the ridge always cleared his mind.<br>
He was rinsing his plate when it happened—a brief flicker, like a candle guttering in a draft. Thomas blinked, and for a moment, the kitchen seemed to dissolve around the edges, revealing...something else. Something dark. He steadied himself against the sink.<br>
_"Just tired,"_ he murmured, rubbing his eyes. _"Didn't sleep well."_<br>
But as he reached for a towel, it happened again. This time, the flicker lasted longer, and was accompanied by a high-pitched whine that seemed to originate inside his own skull. The warm yellow walls of his kitchen blurred, revealing glimpses of concrete gray beneath.
_"No,"_ Thomas whispered, heart suddenly racing. _"No, no, no."_<br>
He pressed his palms against his temples, where a dull ache was building. The room steadied, colors returning to normal, but something had changed. A faint gridwork pattern now overlaid his vision, nearly transparent but undeniably present.
Thomas stumbled to the bathroom, panic rising in his chest. In the mirror, his face looked normal—weathered from years of outdoor work, crow's feet at the corners of his eyes—but now he noticed a thin black line circling his field of vision, like a frame around a picture.<br>
_"System integrity at 42%,"_ said a voice from nowhere. _"Please prepare for emergency shutdown."_<br>
_"Override!"_ Thomas shouted, the word coming to his lips unbidden. _"Emergency override code Lazarus-9!"_<br>
The voice fell silent. The gridwork faded slightly, but didn't disappear. Thomas's hands trembled as he splashed cold water on his face. When he looked up again, something was attached to his face in the mirror—a sleek visor that wrapped around his head, its surface cracked along the right side.<br>
Reality fractured. The bathroom tile flickered, revealing rust-stained metal. The scent of lavender soap gave way to the acrid smell of electrical burning.<br>
Then, like a film ripping apart, the world of Meadowbrook tore away.<br>
<br>
Thomas gasped, his lungs filling with stale, fetid air that tasted of dust and decay. He was seated in a chair—not his wooden kitchen chair, but a molded plastic recliner covered in cracked synthetic leather. Wires snaked from the visor on his face to a humming console beside him.<br>
The bunker was dark, illuminated only by the dim emergency lights that pulsed an anemic red. The main power had failed weeks ago. Or was it months? The backup generators were running on fumes, sputtering and wheezing like dying animals.<br>
As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, Thomas saw what he had been spared from seeing each time he'd briefly surfaced from the VR for maintenance—the true extent of his isolation. The bunker wasn't just failing; it was a tomb.<br>
In the chair across from him sat what remained of Dr. Harlow, the bunker's physician. His desiccated corpse still wore its visor, head tilted back as if gazing at some distant wonder in his own private virtual paradise. The feeding tubes had run dry long ago, but the system had kept running, keeping him in blissful ignorance as his body withered.<br>
Thomas struggled to his feet, legs atrophied and weak. Pain shot through his joints as he shuffled forward, pulling free the tubes and catheters that had sustained him. The floor was sticky beneath his bare feet—leaked fluids, both mechanical and human, had formed a tacky film over everything.<br>
He stumbled into the corridor, where the true horror of his situation became clear. Bodies everywhere. Some slumped against walls, others curled up in corners. Many still wore their visors, having chosen to die in their dreams rather than face reality. The technical staff had been the first to go, knowing there was no fixing what had broken outside. Then the medical team, once they realized the supplies wouldn't last. The military personnel had held out longest, maintaining some semblance of order until the radiation sickness took them.<br>
In the communal area, a family of four sat around a table, posed as if sharing a meal, their skeletal hands still clutching empty plates. Someone's sick idea of normalcy in the end.
Thomas knew without checking that he was the last one alive. The automated systems had continued feeding and hydrating him, perhaps due to some glitch in the prioritization protocols. Or maybe he'd been chosen for some reason—the last human to witness the end.<br>
The monitoring room confirmed what he already knew. The screens, those that still functioned, showed nothing but static chaos outside. Radiation levels far beyond survivable limits. Atmospheric toxins so concentrated they appeared as a dense purple fog. Temperature readings fluctuated wildly between extremes that would scorch flesh and freeze blood.<br>
There was no salvation coming. No restoration teams. No eventual surface reclamation. That had all been propaganda fed into the VR—hopeful narratives to keep the bunker inhabitants compliant while the world died completely.<br>
Thomas stumbled back to his cell, passing the research lab where three technicians had died at their stations, still trying to find some solution. Their notes, scattered across terminals, told the story of increasingly desperate measures considered: genetic modification to survive the new environment, cryogenic preservation, even more elaborate VR systems that would allow consciousness to persist after biological death.<br>
All failures.<br>
In his cell, Thomas examined his damaged visor under the weak light of his personal terminal. The crack had spread across the neural interface—a fatal flaw that would soon render the entire system unusable. He had maybe one more immersion left before it failed completely.<br>
His hands shook as he rummaged through the spare parts box. Most of the components had been scavenged long ago by others attempting their own repairs. What little remained was insufficient for any meaningful fix.<br>
The bunker groaned around him, concrete stressed beyond its tolerances, rebar slowly surrendering to rust and pressure. Another section must have collapsed somewhere; dust sifted down from the ceiling like poisoned snow.<br>
Thomas slumped against the wall, surveying what remained of his world. A twelve-by-twelve concrete cell. A failing VR system. A body that had forgotten how to live outside the simulation. And all around him, the silent company of the dead who had chosen dreams over facing their end.
His eyes fell on the emergency kit beneath his bed—the one thing no one had bothered to steal. Inside, past the useless bandages and expired medications, lay a small vial of clear liquid labeled **"FINAL PROTOCOL."**<br>
Thomas held it to the dim light. He'd never understood why they'd been issued these when the VR was supposed to be their salvation. Now he knew. Someone had anticipated this moment—when the illusion could no longer be maintained, when reality became too unbearable to face.
With trembling fingers, he loaded the liquid into an injector. The bunker shuddered again, more violently this time. A pipe burst somewhere, releasing a hiss of contaminated steam. The life support systems were giving up their last gasps.<br>
Thomas carefully replaced the damaged visor on his head and settled back into his recliner. He reconnected the necessary tubes—no need for waste management anymore—and powered up the system.
_"Warning: critical system failure imminent,"_ the automated voice informed him. _"Estimated remaining operational time: three hours, seventeen minutes."_<br>
That would be enough. More than enough.<br>
Thomas pressed the injector against his arm, felt the cold spread of the clear liquid into his vein. His heartbeat slowed immediately, a peaceful lethargy spreading through his limbs.
_"System rebooting,"_ said the neutral voice. _"Reestablishing neural connection. Welcome back to Meadowbrook, Thomas."_<br>
The concrete walls dissolved, replaced by his sunlit kitchen. The scent of mint tea and fresh bread returned. Through the window, he could see Mrs. Wilkins waving at him, gesturing toward the hills where the blueberries grew.<br>
Thomas smiled, already feeling the pleasant numbness spreading from his arm through his chest. He would take that walk now. He would climb to the ridge and watch the sunset over the valley. And when night fell, he would lie among the wildflowers and look up at stars untainted by nuclear fire, unmarred by humanity's final folly.<br>
As he stepped out into the perfect spring day, his physical body slumped in the chair, the last living heart in a concrete grave filled with the dead, finally surrendering to stillness.<br>
It wasn't real. But it was beautiful. And in the end, that was all that remained: the mercy of illusion as humanity flickered out.<br>
