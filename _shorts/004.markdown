Maxwell Jenkins had always dreamed of being remembered in the annals of space exploration history.<br>
As the geologist on Europa Mission Six, he expected to achieve fame through meticulous ice core samples and brilliant analysis of Jupiter's most promising moon. Instead, his name would become immortalized for an entirely different reason.<br>
The research outpost on Europa consisted of six pressurized domes connected by sealed corridors, each maintaining Earth-like conditions despite the hostile environment outside. Max's specialty was ice core analysis, which required a special research tent set up directly on Europa's surface, accessible through an airlock.<br>
_"Don't mess with any samples without logging them first,"_<br>
Commander Chen had warned the crew. But Max had spotted what looked like an unusual crystalline formation in his latest core sample and couldn't resist investigating alone after hours.<br>
The research tent was heated just enough to prevent equipment failure while maintaining the integrity of the ice samples. The floor was simply the moon's actual surface, slightly modified with insulation pads around the drilling area. Max had been examining cores all day when he noticed something peculiar – a section of the floor that seemed to be... melting.<br>
What started as a small dimple in the ice quickly developed into a perfectly circular aperture about twenty centimeters in diameter. The hole wasn't merely melting; it was forming with uncanny precision, its edges glistening with an iridescent blue-green film that pulsed slightly, almost like it was breathing. The interior walls weren't solid ice at all, but lined with a slick, gelatinous substance that gave off a faint bioluminescent glow. Droplets of what appeared to be warm, viscous liquid periodically formed and slid down the inner walls, keeping the entire formation surprisingly moist despite the regulated environment. A subtle mist rose from the depths, carrying with it an oddly sweet, alien scent.<br>
Max should have triggered the emergency protocols immediately. Instead, an extraordinarily poor combination of late-night fatigue, lonelyness, scientific curiosity, and questionable judgment led to what mission control would later diplomatically code as an "unauthorized biological interface with indigenous lifeform."<br>
Having already changed into comfortable sweats for his overnight shift, it took embarrassingly little effort for Max to insert his member into the enticing hole, drawn by both scientific intrigue and an impulse he would later be unable to explain to the ethics committee.<br>
The sensation was immediate and unlike anything in human experience. Max's startled yelp echoed through the tent, but thankfully not through any active comms channels.<br>
_"What the—"_ he gasped, struggling to extricate himself from what appeared to be a curious, gelatinous entity with surprising grip strength.<br>
The creature—later named Maximus Libidinosus in a cruel joke by the xenobiology team—turned out to be a primitive but friendly filter-feeding organism that had mistaken Max's intrusion for an unusually shaped food source. It had apparently sensed the warmth of the research tent and created the perfect lure: a moist, inviting aperture designed to attract whatever passed for prey in Europa's subsurface ocean.<br>
Six months later, back on Earth, Max sat uncomfortably through yet another congressional hearing.<br>
_"And you maintain, Mr. Jenkins, that this... interaction with the specimen was purely in the interest of science?"_ asked the stern-faced senator.<br>
_"Absolutely, Senator,"_ Max replied, avoiding eye contact.<br> _"I was merely attempting a, uh, tactile assessment of the organism's properties."_<br>
Meanwhile, in a Europa research lab, scientists were horrified to discover that the alien species had evolved at an unprecedented rate, developing a bizarre appetite for dangling appendages and a mating call that sounded suspiciously like _"Who's your daddy?"_
