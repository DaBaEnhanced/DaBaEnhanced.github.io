The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as Marcus sat in the pristine white courtroom.

The judge—whose official title was "Equity Facilitator"—peered down at him through thick-rimmed glasses that matched their teal jumpsuit, the color designated for those who had achieved Level 9 Ally status.
_"Marcus Thorne, you stand accused of Pronoun Negligence in the Third Degree. How do you identify your plea?"_

Marcus cleared his throat._"Guilty, I suppose. Though in my defense—"_

_"Objection!"_ The prosecutor shot up. _"The accused is using possessive language that implies ownership of a defense, which could trigger those with authority trauma."_

_"Sustained,"_ the Equity Facilitator nodded. _"Mr. Thorne—"_

_"Actually,"_ interrupted the court clerk, _"we cannot confirm the accused's gender presentation without their explicit consent form, which remains unsigned."_

The Equity Facilitator pinched the bridge of their nose. _"Correct. Person Thorne, please explain the incident from your perspective, using only approved terminology from the Inclusive Lexicon, 37th Edition."_

Marcus nodded. _"Well, I was buying my lab-grown, carbon-neutral coffee substitute—"_

_"Objection! 'My' is possessive language!"_

_"Sustained."_

Marcus sighed. _"The coffee substitute that was being purchased by this person was in a compostable cup. The barista—"_

_"Beverage Artisan,"_ corrected the prosecutor.

_"Right. The Beverage Artisan asked if this person would like oat milk, and this person said, 'No thanks, she can just use the regular soy.'"_

A collective gasp filled the courtroom.
_"And you were aware,"_ the Equity Facilitator's voice was ice, _"that the Beverage Artisan's pronouns are xe/xem/xyr?"_

_"Look, xe had a name tag, but it was covered by xyr hair. How was I supposed to—"_

_"Ignorance is no excuse,"_ the prosecutor interrupted. _"We found evidence that Person Thorne failed to complete their mandatory weekly Pronoun Awareness Refresher course for three consecutive cycles."_

The jury—officially called the "Consensus Collective"—murmured disapprovingly.

_"What does Person Thorne do for employment?"_ asked the Equity Facilitator.

_"This person writes comedy. Or tries to,"_ Marcus said.

_"Comedy?"_ The Equity Facilitator raised an eyebrow. _"That practice was reclassified as Potential Harm Speech in 2041."_

_"Yes, which is why this person writes it secretly. On paper. With pencils."_
Another gasp.

_"Pencils made of trees?"_ someone in the gallery shrieked.

_"No, no,"_ Marcus said quickly. _"Pencils made from recycled politician promises. Completely sustainable. They're hollow."_

The prosecutor approached the bench. _"We'd like to question the accused about their comedy writing."_

_"Proceed,"_ said the Equity Facilitator.

_"Person Thorne, would you say your so-called 'comedy' sometimes makes people... uncomfortable?"_

_"That's rather the point of comedy,"_ Marcus replied.

The courtroom erupted in chaos. The Equity Facilitator banged their gavel, which made a soft thumping sound to avoid noise pollution.
_"Order! We will have order or everyone must report for additional Peaceful Engagement training!"_

When quiet returned, the prosecutor continued. _"Person Thorne, how many sensitivity disclaimers do you include before your 'jokes'?"_

_"None. Again, they're written on paper. For myself."_

_"So you admit to creating unsafe content without proper content warnings?"_

Marcus looked at the ceiling. _"I once wrote a joke about a chicken crossing the road without acknowledging the privilege of bipedal mobility."_

Several members of the Consensus Collective fainted.

After three hours of additional questioning, during which Marcus admitted to using terms like "crazy" (ableist), "blind spot" (visually exclusive), and "brainstorm" (neurologically inconsiderate), the Consensus Collective delivered their verdict.

_"We find the accused guilty of all charges, including the newly added offense of Historical Humor Perpetuation."_

The Equity Facilitator nodded gravely. _"The sentence is Permanent Identity Suspension. To be carried out immediately."_

As they led Marcus to the Compassionate Conclusion Chamber, a reporter from the State-Approved Information Network approached.
_"Any final words for the viewing community, Person Thorne?"_

Marcus looked directly into the camera as they placed the biodegradable hemp rope around his neck.
_"Don't worry—my carbon footprint ends here, but my joke footprint is eternal."_

The trap door opened before anyone could process their outrage.
