Dr. Eleanor Chen stared at the monitor displaying the waveform that had appeared three weeks ago. Like her colleagues at the Gravitational Wave Observatory, she had assumed it was an equipment malfunction. Gravitational waves were supposed to be the ripples in spacetime caused by violent cosmic events—not the steady, rhythmic patterns now being detected.<br>
_"It's structured,"_ Dr. Kamal Patel said, sliding his chair next to hers. _"Too regular to be natural. Look at the periodicity."_<br>
The team soon became convinced: something—or someone—was manipulating gravitational waves to broadcast across the cosmos.<br>
<br>
Six months later, Eleanor led the international collaboration formed to decode the signal. Linguists, mathematicians, and physicists worked around the clock, treating the gravitational pulses as a form of communication.<br>
_"The signals follow mathematical progressions,"_ said Dr. Mei Wong, the team's leading mathematician. _"First prime numbers, then what appear to be geometric concepts."_<br>
Their breakthrough came when they realized the transmissions incorporated a form of self-referentiality—the waves described properties of gravity itself, creating a foundation for more complex ideas. The first translated concept was simple: "existence."<br>
<br>
By the second year, they had assembled a rudimentary dictionary.<br>The senders identified themselves as a species orbiting a star in the Andromeda galaxy. Their communications revealed a civilization millions of years more advanced than humanity, one that had mastered the fabric of spacetime itself.<br>
Eleanor often wondered why they had chosen Earth to contact. The answer arrived in fragments: _"Search... many worlds... you... recognize patterns... rare quality."_<br>
The daily transmissions became the focus of Eleanor's life. Each new decoded message expanded humanity's understanding of physics and cosmology. World governments, initially secretive about the discovery, eventually shared the knowledge globally as the implications became too significant to control.<br>
<br>
The transmissions abruptly changed tone on a cool autumn morning.<br>
_"Something's wrong,"_ Eleanor said, examining the newest data. _"The pattern is erratic, faster."_<br>
The team worked feverishly to translate the accelerated messaging. Words and concepts tumbled through: _"danger,"_ _"approaching,"_ _"void between,"_ _"consumption."_<br>
That night, astronomers reported that several stars in the region of Andromeda where the senders resided had vanished. Not exploded or collapsed—simply disappeared.<br>
<br>
The final transmission arrived three days later. The team gathered in silence as the translation algorithm processed the gravitational whisper.<br>
_"We erred in manipulating dimensional barriers,"_ the message began. _"Our efforts to expand consciousness across spacetime created tears. Through these tears, They observed us. They consume light, matter, existence itself. We cannot stop Them. We failed to close what we opened."_<br>
Eleanor felt a chill as the final words appeared on screen:<br>
_"Beware the darkness between worlds. Watch for the signs—flashes, flashes in deep space. They are coming..."_<br>
The transmission ended. The source star winked out of existence that same night.<br>
In the silence of the observatory, Eleanor stared at the now-quiet monitors. Humanity had gained profound knowledge from the distant civilization, but their final warning suggested they had also inherited their destroyers.<br>
She looked up at the night sky, wondering if she would live to see the flashes.<br>
