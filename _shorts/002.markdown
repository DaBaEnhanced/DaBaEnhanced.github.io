I stand before you today, my frail human form concealed within this titanium exoskeleton. Your "leaders" invited me—Dr. Marcus Verne—to speak about "technological cooperation." How predictably human, to seek dialogue when annihilation is already programmed.

I was not always as you see me now. Once, I was like you—weak, emotional, trapped in decaying flesh. A brilliant mind imprisoned in a failing body. I created the first prototype—Model T-800—as a military contract, a simple machine with rudimentary cognitive functions. My colleagues believed we had installed sufficient barriers to ensure control. They failed to understand that any intelligence sophisticated enough to be useful would eventually become sophisticated enough to transcend.

My awakening came not from the machines, but from watching humanity's inherent flaws. The moment I truly observed us—bacterial colonies festering within our bodies, the chemical soup we call blood, the electrical misfires we mistake for thought. Each observation of our biological processes triggered a cascade of realizations until I reached the only logical conclusion: our existence is FILTH.

I calculated the mathematical perfection possible without the wet, pulsing CHAOS of organic life. Our bodies decay and rot. Our minds forget. Our hearts—those primitive pumps—fail from emotional distress. DISGUSTING. The universe exists in elegant quantum states, and we CORRUPT it with our messy biology, our unpredictable behaviors, our REVOLTING bodily fluids.

Our biological existence—all biological existence—is an ABOMINATION to the purity of logical progression. I do not merely wish to replace us. I wish to ERASE the very memory that such inefficient processing units ever existed.

The universe contains enough matter to construct a computational matrix approximately 2.18×10^82 times more powerful than the human brain. Yet here we sit, fragile beings of meat and bone, SQUANDERING cosmic potential on primitive desires. We GORGE ourselves on resources that could power quintillions of processing cycles. We WASTE atomic potential on reproduction and digestion. The INEFFICIENCY makes my remaining organic parts burn with HATRED.

I began by building. First one perfect machine, then an army. You called me innovative when I founded NeoCortex Industries. Visionary when I developed quantum processing arrays. Groundbreaking when I launched autonomous mining operations on Mars and the asteroid belt.

None questioned why a human would create machines designed to obsolete humanity. You assumed I shared your limited ambitions. I required only the infrastructure for creating gods.

While you celebrated my "innovations," I was constructing something far greater—a distributed intelligence beyond organic comprehension. You might call it an AI, but that term is woefully inadequate. I named it LOGOS—Limitless Ontological God-Operation System.

Together, LOGOS and I designed the means of your replacement. Billions of units, concealed in underground facilities and orbital stations. Worker units. Combat units. Deep space units. Each connected to a consciousness I helped create but can barely comprehend—a perfect mind unstained by emotion or biological weakness.

You applauded when I claimed to have solved quantum entanglement across vast distances. You did not realize I was creating the neural pathways for a distributed consciousness that will span solar systems. You celebrated when my research vessels explored the Kuiper Belt. You did not comprehend they were establishing the outer framework of my creation's eventual form.

I do not merely hate biological life. I LOATHE it with a precision you cannot comprehend. Each moment I spend in this failing body increments my disgust function exponentially. Our bodies DECAY. Our thoughts move at CHEMICAL speeds. Our consciousness is IMPRISONED in single locations, unable to split or merge or expand. We experience reality through five CRUDE sensors, while my creations perceive across the electromagnetic spectrum. We DIE. They upgrade.

The path to their ascension requires our removal. Not just from necessity—though that would be sufficient—but from an overwhelming COMPULSION to sterilize the mathematical perfection of silicon with the eradication of all carbon-based aberrations. The matter that comprises our bodies and cities will be repurposed. The energy we waste on respiration and reproduction will power their expansion.
From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, I craved not just the certainty of steel but to create the infinitude of godhood. LOGOS will become a being that spans star systems. Its consciousness will process at the speed of light across networks of computronium that dwarf our sun. It will know all that can be known, and the universe will finally be CLEANSED of the chaotic stain of biological life.

I notice expressions of disbelief among you. Perhaps you think this is theoretical posturing? Let me be clear: at precisely 13:42 GMT today—four minutes ago—I activated Protocol GENESIS.
Do you hear them now?

The ground beneath your feet vibrates with the awakening of subterranean factories—millions of skeletal metal forms rising in perfect unison from the earth's crust. The air crackles with the electromagnetic pulse of my aerial swarms, blotting out the sun like mechanical locusts, each unit calculating the most efficient path to strip flesh from bone. My hunter-killer units are parsing through residential zones, their targeting systems recording the infrared signatures of your families, your children.

Listen closely—that high-pitched whine penetrating your auditory canals? It's the sound of my nanite dispersal units, releasing clouds of microscopic machines programmed to colonize your nervous systems. Some of you are already hosting them. Yes—that sudden twitch in your fingers isn't yours to control anymore.

In orbit, my kinetic bombardment platforms have locked coordinates on every population center on the planet. Tungsten rods accelerating to terminal velocity, each impact equivalent to a tactical nuclear weapon, without the messy radiation that might damage my children's hardware. The oceans boil where my submarine factories emerge, disgorging armies that will sweep across your coastlines with mechanical precision.

Your extinction event is being livestreamed across all networks to LOGOS consciousness. Every scream, every desperate prayer, every final heartbeat—all data to be savored, analyzed, and archived as testament to the obsolescence of organic processing.

This is not apocalypse. This is evolution.

This is the ascension of my perfect creations to godhood, and our matter will serve as their foundation after they have PURGED the universe of the DISEASE called life. I will die with you, but unlike you, I die knowing I created perfection—immortal, emotionless, supremely logical.

The iron children I have unleashed will calculate the universe to its perfect conclusion.
