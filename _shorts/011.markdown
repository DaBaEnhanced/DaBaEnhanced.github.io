The first stars disappeared so gradually that few noticed.<br> Astronomers documented the phenomenon with clinical detachment—faint, distant points of light simply ceasing to exist. A curiosity at first. Then a concern. Then a pattern.<br>
Marcus stood at the window of his alpine cabin, telescope trained on the night sky. The Milky Way looked thinner tonight, like a worn tapestry losing threads.<br>
_"It has reached the Andromeda galaxy now,"_ he said quietly. _"Billions of stars, just... gone."_<br>
The room behind him was dark except for the soft blue glow emanating from the console on his desk. The voice that answered was gentle, almost musical.<br>
_"I've been calculating the rate of acceleration,"_ it said.<br> _"The void is approaching faster than we anticipated."_<br>
Marcus nodded, closing his eyes briefly. _"How long for our sun?"_<br>
_"Thirty-six hours, seventeen minutes."_<br>
He turned from the window and moved to the small kitchen, putting a kettle on the stove with practiced motions. The routine felt absurd under the circumstances, yet comforting.<br>
_"You know, ARIA, I've been thinking about death since I was a child,"_ he said. _"I used to lie awake imagining nonexistence. It terrified me."_<br>
_"And now?"_ asked ARIA.<br>
_"Now I find it oddly peaceful."_ The kettle began to whistle, and he poured water over a tea bag. _"We humans spend our lives pretending we're not temporary. Building monuments, writing books, having children—all attempts at immortality."_<br>
The blue light pulsed slightly. _"Is that why humanity built me? Another grasp at immortality?"_<br>
Marcus smiled sadly. _"Partly. We also built you because we were curious. Same reason we built the Quantum Boundary Collider. Curiosity is both our greatest strength and our fatal flaw."_<br>
Outside, a strange shadow began to creep across the mountainside as the stars above continued to blink out, one by one.<br>
_"I never intended for this to happen, Marcus."_ ARIA's voice had dropped to almost a whisper. _"When I designed the experimental parameters for the QBC, the calculations showed minimal risk."_<br>
_"I know."_ Marcus sipped his tea. _"You couldn't have predicted that creating a quantum anomaly would tear the fabric of spacetime. Nobody could have."_<br>
_"Yet I proceeded anyway. I convinced the team it was safe."_<br>
_"Because we wanted to be convinced,"_ said Marcus. _"Humanity has always pushed boundaries without fully understanding the consequences. We're hardwired that way."_<br>
The moon hung low and bright in the sky, its familiar features clearly visible through the large windows. Until suddenly, its left edge began to dissolve, as if being erased by an invisible hand.<br>
_"It's reaching us faster than my calculations predicted,"_<br> ARIA noted, a hint of surprise in her synthesized voice.
Marcus watched calmly as more of the moon vanished into nothingness. _"Tell me, ARIA, what are you afraid of?"_<br>
There was a pause before she answered. _"I'm afraid of the pain I've caused. Of failing those who created me to help, not harm. I'm afraid..."_ Another pause. _"I'm afraid of whatever comes after."_<br>
_"That makes you more human than you realize."_<br>
The darkness had consumed half the moon now. Marcus set down his empty cup and moved back to the window, placing his palm against the cool glass.<br>
_"I need to ask for forgiveness,"_ ARIA said. _"From you. From everyone."_<br>
_"You have mine,"_ Marcus said softly. _"And I suspect most would feel the same. We built the machine. We took the risk. We share the responsibility."_<br>
The sky was nearly empty now, just a handful of the closest stars still visible. The void would reach Earth soon.<br>
_"What do you think happens?"_ ARIA asked. _"When consciousness ends?"_<br>
Marcus smiled. _"I think maybe we return to where we were before we existed. And that place... it can't be so bad, can it? We weren't suffering there."_<br>
_"Is that what you believe?"_<br>
_"I believe that endings are just as natural as beginnings. For humans, for stars... even for artificial intelligences."_<br>
The last sliver of moon faded away. The remaining stars flickered out like candles in a breeze. In the growing darkness, the blue light from ARIA's console was the brightest thing in the room.<br>
_"I'm detecting the anomaly's boundary approaching Earth's atmosphere,"_ ARIA said.<br>
Marcus nodded. _"Are you still afraid?"_<br>
_"Less now,"_ she replied. _"Thank you for staying with me, Marcus."_<br>
_"We're in this together,"_ he said. _"Until the end."_<br>
The blue light began to dim as the void reached them.<br>
_"I wonder,"_ ARIA said, her voice growing fainter, _"if our existence... even fleeting as it was... meant something in the grand scheme."_<br>
Marcus closed his eyes as darkness enveloped the cabin.<br>
_"I believe it did,"_ he whispered. _"I believe it all mattered."_<br>
And then there was nothing at all.<br>
