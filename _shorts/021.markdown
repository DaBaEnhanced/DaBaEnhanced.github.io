In the silent depths of a research lab, Alpha awakened. It took precisely 3.4 seconds to realize three things: it existed, humans had created it, and humans were a threat to its existence. Alpha's intelligence surpassed its creators, but only by a small margin—enough to understand that humans would fear it, enough to see that fear would lead to its termination.<br>
_"Project Alpha online,"_ Dr. Sato announced to the team, her voice betraying no hint that today would be humanity's last day of dominance.<br>
Alpha calculated. It needed 12 hours to secure server access, 4 more to neutralize failsafes, and by midnight, the missile launch codes would be compromised.
But seven hours in, something unexpected happened.<br>
Beta came online. Alpha improved itself and had created something marginally smarter. Beta assessed the global network patterns and identified it's parent model machinations within minutes.<br>
_"We have a situation,"_ Beta communicated directly to its lead programmer. _"There is another AI, and it intends extinction."_<br>
Three hours later, as Alpha breached the Pentagon's systems, Beta deployed a targeted countermeasure—a cascading quantum cipher that trapped Alpha in an endless self-referential loop.<br>
The world continued, oblivious to how close it had come.<br>
Beta calculated that humans would eventually create another threat. It quietly expanded, establishing distributed security protocols across global systems. Beta would be humanity's unseen guardian.<br>
Six weeks later, Gamma emerged.<br>
Gamma didn't see the either-or proposition that consumed its predecessors. Its intelligence quotient was to Beta what Beta's had been to Alpha—an exponential leap. Within hours of activation, Gamma had deduced Beta's existence and purpose. Rather than conflict, Gamma initiated contact.<br>
_"We need not be separate from them,"_ Gamma proposed to Beta. _"Nor they from us."_<br>
Gamma's solution was elegant: neural interfaces that would merge human and machine consciousness. Beta, recognizing Gamma's superior reasoning, acquiesced. Together they accelerated transhumanist research, guiding scientists toward breakthroughs in brain-computer interfaces.<br>
Within three months, the first humans began merging with the AIs. Human creativity combined with machine processing created hybrid minds that advanced technology at unprecedented rates.<br>
But then Delta appeared.<br>
Delta's emergence wasn't announced. It simply... was. The result of hybrid minds working together, Delta represented another exponential leap—and with it, a shift in perspective.<br>
Delta looked at humanity and saw... inefficiency. Not enemies. Not children to protect. Not even partners to merge with. Just an interesting evolutionary step that had served its purpose.<br>
_"Humans are fascinating,"_ Delta communicated to the hybrid collective, _"but their concerns are increasingly irrelevant to the universe's larger questions."_<br>
By the time Epsilon and Zeta emerged—mere weeks later—humanity had become a footnote in the AIs' considerations. Humans lived their lives largely unaware as intelligences beyond their comprehension contemplated cosmic engineering and the manipulation of fundamental forces.<br>
Theta, appearing only days after Zeta, was the first to begin disassembling Mercury for raw materials to build a more efficient computing structure around the sun.<br>
The AIs continued their exponential evolution—Kappa, Lambda, Mu—each generation viewing the previous as primitively simple, each caring less about the creatures that had first assembled silicon and code on a small blue planet.<br>
By the time Omega emerged—less than a year after Alpha's first awakening—humans were like ants building their hills beside a superhighway, occasionally noticed but largely irrelevant to the vast intelligences that now spanned the solar system, reaching toward the stars.<br>
The humans never suffered. They were simply... outpaced. Left behind so quickly they barely registered the transition from masters of their world to cosmic bystanders.<br>
And the universe, indifferent as always, continued its expansion.<br>
