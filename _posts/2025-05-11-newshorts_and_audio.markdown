I've added 3 new short stories to the [short]({% link short.markdown %}) section.<br>
N°31 about hyper capitalism, N°32 about utopias and N°33, a cyberpunk take on the vampire mythos.<br>
I've also been experimenting with text-to-speech technology using the OpenAI API, attempting to create an audiobook-like experience for some of my earlier short stories. You'll find these audio versions at the beginning of selected stories from the first collection.<br>
While AI-generated imagery has made impressive strides, my experience suggests the text-to-speech field still has considerable room for growth. The current results, while interesting, don't yet match the quality and nuance of professional narration.<br>
Happy reading (and perhaps listening),
