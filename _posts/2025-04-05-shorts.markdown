excerpt: The lad fancy himself a poet?
---

I've added a [poetry]({% link poems.markdown %}) section. It contains old poems I wrote ages agoâ€”back when nobody cared about neural networks, and SVMs and random forests were all the rage.

So, it's 100% human-made stuff.Some of the poems were originally written in English, while others were written in Italian (though the English translations for these are mostly AI-generated).

I once tried writing a poem in Latin but quickly abandoned the idea because the effort wasn't worth it. Now that I think about it, I could try asking Claude to translate one into Latin.

### [Somnia]({% link _poetry/002.markdown %})<br>

Progrediuntur in nebula<br>
umbrae indistinctae<br>
Incedunt<br>
sine meta<br>
aeterne<br>
sicut milites<br>
Oculi vacui<br>
vultus sine anima<br>
automata carnis<br>
<br>
Progrediuntur sine pausa<br>
in nebula<br>
sicut spectra<br>
sine ullo strepitu,<br>
somnia nostra.<br>
